    <p>Losing weight is something many people think about, and its not as hard as you might think all it requires is the willingness and strong resolve to go through and actually lose the weight you want.  </p>
    <h1>Set a Goal</h1>
    <p>Setting a goal is important, Because it gives you something to work towards whether its a certain weight you want to achieve or a certain amount of body fat. </p>
    <h1>Dieting</h1>
<p>Start eating a healthy diet. Because without a proper diet you are just gonna be waisting your time, this includes junk food and drinks. Drinks more than food because it's better to eat your calories than to drink them.</p>
    <h1>Exercise</h1>
    <p>Start off with some small exercises ex. Running, Swimming, Going for hikes even choosing to walk up stares than use the elevators or escalators will work in helping lose weight.  </p>
    <p>Once you are comfortable with the small exercises you can move onto weight training. (Note. Losing weight and gaining muscle are two different things, Gaining muscle can ask that you put on weight before gaining muscle.)</p>
    <h1>Stick to It</h1>
    <p>If you get to your desired weight and then just suddenly pig out and eat a ton of junk food/drinks your body wont be used to all the sugar and extra fats that your body will just store it all making you gain weight.</p>
